Data structure for queues
	-Deadline based
		Operations: Insert
		Minheap
			Copy deadline over
		Q-node: pointer + deadline
		
	-No deadline based FIFO array: circular queue with start = task.
		As soon as task is over, start++;
		
		q_no_deadline.h
			scheduler_q_n_d: Circular queue operations with process* array
			
		w_wait_deadline.h
		q_deadline.h
		
		//Same thing!

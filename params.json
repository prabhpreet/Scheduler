It's still developing so hold on tight!\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n```\r\nprocess p[10];\r\n//Define process parameters, given in struct\r\nscheduler_init();\r\nscheduler();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Experimenting with algorithms\r\nTill now we've only tried EDF. Stay tuned!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPrabhpreet Singh Dua (@PrabhpreetD)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThe project is still in developing stages.
